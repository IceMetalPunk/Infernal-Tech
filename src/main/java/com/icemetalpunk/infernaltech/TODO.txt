TODO:
1. Radiant Hellfire Smeltery textures
2. Pipes of some sort (hellfire smelteries with hot blocks under them are hard to automate from the bottom!)
3. Soul Strands / Possession Cores   -> A Soul Distiller block: when a mob is killed near it, it adds to its Soul count, and after reaching 100%, it creates a Soul Strand of that mob's type
    --> 100% is determined by mob type; better mobs take more to distill
    -> Soul Strands can be crafted into Possession Core blocks
    --> Possession Cores require Soul Strands of their type as fuel
    --> If a mob at low HP stands on a Possession Core of its type long enough, it becomes "possessed"
    --> Possessed mobs change their AI in ways that benefit the player, different for each mob
    ----> Note: make sure to store possession status in NBT and reset AI when constructing a possessed mob, for relogs to work!
    ----> Note 2: A visual indicator of possession would be nice :) 
4. More infernal tech!
5. Bloodthorn trees?
    -> Natural, or grown only with special saplings?
    --> If saplings, how do you make them?
    -> Hurt on contact like cactus
    -> Fireproof
