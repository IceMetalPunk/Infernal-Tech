TODO:
1. Pipes of some sort (hellfire smelteries with hot blocks under them are hard to automate from the bottom!)
    --> Greed Glass: Gazing Glass surrounded by blaze rods; can be configured to pull items from certain sides of nearby blocks wirelessly
            using a Spirit Stick (Spirit Glass 3-diagonal stick). 2x2 internal inventory; can input and output items from all sides
2. RF power gen: lava or something else?
3. Blazing Heater, Blazing Scorcher, and Blazing Incinerator
    --> 3 tiers of mob "grinder"
    --> Uses power to increase the damage of magma blocks above them
    --> Scorcher (tier 2) and above even burns mobs normally immune to fire damage
4. Soul Strands / Possession Cores
    -> A Soul Distiller block: when a mob is killed near it, it adds to its Soul count, and after reaching 100%, it creates a Soul Strand of that mob's type
    --> 100% is determined by mob type; better mobs take more to distill
    -> Soul Strands can be crafted into Possession Core blocks
    --> Possession Cores require Soul Strands of their type as fuel
    --> If a mob at low HP stands on a Possession Core of its type long enough, it becomes "possessed"
    --> Possessed mobs change their AI in ways that benefit the player, different for each mob
    ----> Note: make sure to store possession status in NBT and reset AI when constructing a possessed mob, for relogs to work!
    ----> Note 2: A visual indicator of possession would be nice :) 
5. Corruption Cores
    -> Take RF to convert mobs in the area into Infernal mobs
    --> Skeletons into wither skellies, villagers into witches, pigs into zombie pigmen, horses into zombie horses, etc.
    ----> (If possible, add Nightmares, black-and-red horses that are hostile and spit fire?)
6. More infernal tech!
7. Bloodthorn trees?
    -> Natural, or grown only with special saplings?
    --> If saplings, how do you make them?
    -> Hurt on contact like cactus
    -> Fireproof
